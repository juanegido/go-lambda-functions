### `cmd`

Place your functions. A dir matches to an end-point: `/.netlify/functions/hello`.
Each dir should have `main.go` as `package main`.

### `internal/pkg`

Place your common package for sharing among multiple functions.
In this sample, `utils/utils.go` provides `utils.IntroductionYourself` for `hello`, `goodbye` endpoints.

### `dashboard`

This dir will be deployed as a website. The root path for your Netlify app brings visitors here.
Put HTML/assets...etc to support your functions 💪
